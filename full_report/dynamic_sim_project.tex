\section*{Abstract}
\begin{doublespace}
The purpose of this design project was to perform a dynamic simulation of the four-bar windshield wiper mechanism driven by the AM equipment 328 gear motor. Several methods were employed to describe the dynamic response of the mechanism. These processes were in terms of {\tt MATLAB} functions. These include the vector loop method, Newton's method, basic $1^{st}$ and $2^{nd}$ order kinematic coefficient, the power equation, the load torque, the driving torque, and the Euler method function. The end result from this dynamic simulation include the dynamic response of $\dot{\theta}_{2}$ vs. time, $\dot{\theta}_{5}$ vs. time, fluctuation coefficient at steady State, time required for a clean windshield, and the maximum load of wiper. Values for the fluctuation coefficient, time required, and the maximum wiper load were $C_{f} = 6.13 \%$, $t_{req} = 1.83 \quad (seconds)$, $T_{max} = 19.97 \quad (ft lb_{f})$, respectively. These results are discussed in the following section, namely the {\bf Engineering Analysis}.

\section*{Engineering Analysis - Dynamic Analysis for Four-Bar Windshield Wiper Mechanism}
\begin{doublespace}
As described in the {\bf Abstract}, the windshield wiper mechanism consists of a four-bar mechanism driven by an AM Equipment gear motor. Essentially, this mechanism's gear motor rotates link 2 continuously similar to a crank which causes link 4 to oscillate like a rocker. Gear 3 drives gear 5 which oscillates the wiper of nearly $180^{\degree}$. Figure (\ref{xx1}) describes the windshield wiper schematically. To understand and obtain the dynamic analysis of this wiper mechanism it is necessary to provide an illustration of the process. Figure(\ref{x1}) outlines an engineering analysis for determining the $\dot{\theta}_{2}$ vs. time, $\dot{\theta}_{5}$ vs. time, fluctuation coefficient, time required, and the maximum load of wiper. This concept was done using multiple functions to systematically and routinely compute the desired terms.

\begin{doublespace}
Figure (\ref{xx2}) shows the vector loop with link lengths $\vec{r}_{1},\vec{r}_{2},\vec{r}_{3},\vec{r}_{4}$ defining the four-bar mechanism. Vector $\vec{r}_{5}$ is attached to gear 5 and defines the direction of the windshield wiper blade which rotates
with 5. Figure (\ref{xx2}) also shows the assembly configuration where the initial values ${{\theta}_{3}}_{i}$, ${{\theta}_{4}}_{i}$, and ${{\theta}_{5}}_{i}$ are defined. The assembly configuration corresponds to when the four bar mechanism portion is in a limit position ${{}\dot{\theta}_{5}}_{i} = 168.5^{\degree}$ and the windshield wiper is horizontal. The vector loop equation is:
\end{doublespace}
\begin{eqnarray*}
	\vec{r}_{2} + \vec{r}_{3} - \vec{r}_{4} - \vec{r}_{1} = \vec{0}
\end{eqnarray*}
The scalar components of this mechanism are:
\begin{eqnarray}
	{r}_{2}\cos(\theta_{2}) + {r}_{3}\cos(\theta_{3}) - {r}_{4}\cos(\theta_{4}) - {r}_{1} = 0 \label{ee}
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
	{r}_{2}\sin(\theta_{2}) + {r}_{3}\sin(\theta_{3}) - {r}_{4}\sin(\theta_{4}) = 0 \label{e1}
\end{eqnarray}
Since there is only one rolling contact between the gears, the rolling contact equation is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
	\rho_{5}\Delta\theta_{5/4} = -\rho_{3}\Delta\theta_{3/4}
\end{eqnarray*}
In this mechanism $\rho_{5}$ = $\rho_{3}$, which simplifies the rolling contact equation to:
\begin{eqnarray*}
	\Delta\theta_{5/4} = -\Delta\theta_{3/4} \rightarrow \Delta\theta_{5}-\Delta\theta_{4} = -(\Delta\theta_{3} - \Delta\theta_{4}) \rightarrow \Delta\theta_{5} - 2\Delta\theta_{4} + \Delta\theta_{3} = 0
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{eqnarray}
	(\theta_{5}-\theta_{5_i}) - 2(\theta_{4}-\theta_{4_i}) + (\theta_{3}-\theta_{3_i}) = 0 \label{e2}
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{doublespace}
 Equations (\ref{ee})-(\ref{e2}) are a system of three position equations. The scalar knowns in this mechanism are: $\theta_{5_i} = 174^{\degree}$, $\theta_{4_i} = 221^{\degree}$, $\theta_{3_i} = 348^{\degree}$, $\theta_{1} = 0^{\degree}$, ${r}_{1} = 5.625$in., ${r}_{2} = 0.75$in., ${r}_{3} = 5.625$in., ${r}_{4} = 1.3$in., ${r}_{5} = 2$ft. The scalar unknowns for this mechanism are: $\theta_{2}$, $\theta_{3}$, $\theta_{4}$, and $\theta_{5}$. Three position equations with four unknowns means that this mechanism has one degree of freedom. Since $\theta_{2}$ is the input variable, its possible to make a guess in order to obtain $\theta_{3}$, $\theta_{4}$, and $\theta_{5}$.

\section*{Results - Dynamic Analysis for Four-Bar Windshield Wiper Mechanism}
\begin{doublespace}
This section provides the plots of $\dot{\theta}_{2}$ vs $time$, $\dot{\theta}_{5}$ vs $time$, as well as the fluctuation coefficient at steady State, the time required for a clean windshield, and the maximum load of wiper. \\ 
\indent
The values for the coefficient of fluctuation, time required, and the maximum wiper load were $C_{f} = 6.13 \%$, $t_{req} = 1.83 \quad (seconds)$, $T_{max} = 19.97 \quad (ft lb_{f})$, respectively. According to Figure (\ref{x3}), the dynamic simulation shows that steady state is reached at about $t_{req} = 1.83 (seconds)$. At the same moment, in Figure (\ref{x2}) the crank speed oscillates between a maximum of ${{}\dot{\theta}_{2}}_{max} = 33.85 (rpm)$, a minimum of ${{}\dot{\theta}_{2}}_{min} = 31.84 (rpm)$, and an average of ${{}\dot{\theta}_{2}}_{avg} = 32.85 (rpm)$. Evidently, all these values correspond to positive crank velocities because the rotation in this case is counter-clockwise. The steady state speed variation of a machine determined by the coefficient of fluctuation. Here the coefficient of fluctuation is not too extreme. This is desirable since higher fluctuations in the crank speed at steady state leads to extreme operation factors. A few examples of these extremities are large bearing forces, large loading on the motor, and heat due to repeated motor slip. There were multiple prerequisites in order to obtain the dynamic response for this mechanism. One of which was to use Newton's method along with it's vector loop equation. In order to employ Newton's method, one must be able to solve the vector loop equation and take its first $x$ and $y$ component derivatives with respect to the input $\theta_{2}$. The scalar knowns and unknowns were also given to mimic the windshield wiper's response. All relevant information including the complete windshield wiper mechanism can be viewed in {\bf Appendix B}. {\bf Appendix A} identifies a detailed description of the windshield wiper mechanism as well as the gear motor used. This information is critical in order to compute the Basic $1^{st}$ and $2^{nd}$ order Kinematic Coefficient of $h_{3}$, $h_{4}$, $h_{5}$, and $h^{\prime}_{3}$, $h^{\prime}_{4}$, $h^{\prime}_{5}$ with respect to $S_{i} = \theta_{2}$. {\bf Appendix C} to compute the Kinetic Energy for the A terms, B terms and their individual sums, $\sum A$'s and $\sum B$'s. These definitions represent the collection of moving parts within a machine. To obtain this result, the Power Equation in equation will be reduced to only a term representing the rate change in kinetic energy. This is by assuming that at lower inertias and high speeds, kinetic energy tends to dominate potential energy and the power dissipated through friction. Thus, both terms in the power equation can be ignored. After defining the $1^{st}$ and $2^{nd}$ order Kinematic Coefficient and their mass centers, the kinetic energy can be differentiated to obtain the final result on equation (7.5). The inertias considered in this design set are the Wiper Blade, Motor Windings, Worm Gear, and Worm Wheel. These parts are moving within a machine. Therefore, they each have a $1^{st}$ and $2^{nd}$ order Kinematic Coefficient and their mass centers. {\bf Appendix D} describes how the load torque is computed for a given $\theta_{2}$ value. This is done by knowing that the windshield wiper oscillates clockwise to remove the debris from the windshield and counter clock wise to reset the wiper back to its original position. {\bf Appendix E} demonstrates how the driving torque is calculated by finding $T_{stall}$ and the maximum angular velocity of the motor at low speeds on {\bf Appendix A} and also knowing that ${{}\dot{\theta}_{2}}$ is constant throughout the motion the wiper. Finally, {\bf Appendix E} determines ${{}\dot{\theta}_{5}}$, $\delta{\theta_{2}}$, $\delta{t}$, and $\delta{{}\dot{\theta}_{2}}$ in order to successfully compute the solution of the forward dynamics problem such that the loop cycles and iterates for a value of $\theta_{2}$.

\section*{Appendix A}
\begin{doublespace}
This section describes the dynamic simulation and motor selection for the four-bar windshield wiper mechanism. As previously mentioned, to determine the dynamic response of the system, it is necessary to analyze the links of the 4-bar mechanism, its scalar components, the rolling contact equation, and the mechanism's scalar knows and unknowns. The following reference specifies the information page and the conversion table for the AM Equipment 238 gearmotor. The information presented in this gearmotor provide an output torque as a function of the angular velocity, and the gear ratio of the worm gear drive of $83:1$.
