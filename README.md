# Dynamics_Simulation_MATLAB_LaTeX

This is a dynamics simulation of a windshield wiper mechanism using MATLAB 2018. All images and data were extracted from MATLAB and transferred over to a notepad editor. The report was then contructed using codeblocks where "pdflatex" command was used to format it from the notepad editor.

## Getting Started

If you wish to design your own windshield wiper mechanism or if you would like to try the programs out yourself, then first; download code blocks to your computer. Go to your system setting and add the 'PATH' directory from codeblocks. 

### Installing

1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/JonathanDuarteGH/Dynamics_Simulation_MATLAB_LaTeX.git
```

2. Open the downloaded file

3. Explore

```
Enjoy :)
